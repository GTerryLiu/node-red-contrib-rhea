# AMQP 1.0 nodes for Node-RED

This project provides a set of nodes for [Node-RED](http://nodered.org/) that makes it easy to integrate AMQP 1.0 protocol in a flow application.

## Documentation

The official documentation is available [here](doc/Home.md).

## Installation

The nodes are based on [RHEA library](https://github.com/grs/rhea), a reactive library for AMQP protocol for easy development of both clients and servers. It's needed to install that library before starting to use RHEA nodes inside a Node-RED flow. The simpler way to do it is use the Node Package Manager (NPM) and install the ["rhea" module] (https://www.npmjs.com/package/rhea).
